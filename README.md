# DESIGN AND SIMULATION OF PHYSICAL LAYER SECURITY FOR NEXT GENERATION INTELLIGENT OPTICAL NETWORKS
 In this study, two different methods are presented to provide optical encryption and decryption.  1- Using pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS) generated from shot noise fluctuations in P-I-N photodiode  2- Using wavelength converter
